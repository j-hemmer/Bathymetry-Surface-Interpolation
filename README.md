The purpose of this interpolation was to create a bathymetric ocean depth layer using oil well input points.
Two methods of interpolation were compared with each other as well as a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) seismic 3D survey dataset.
GIS files are available in the folder called GIS files, the map layouts are in the map layer folder and the report is the .pdf file.
Parameters were chosen based on literature as well as an assessment of the Kriging assumptions.
